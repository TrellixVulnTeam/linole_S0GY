@BangerTech I just quickly made a couple changes so it should detect your device but Im not certain. let me know if any of the steps do or dont work.

But to test you will need to clone the repository and run it: (note some of the flag names that I currently have dont make much sense)

$ git clone https://github.com/MarshallAsch/liquidctl.git
$ cd liquidctl
$ git checkout commander-pro
$ sudo python3 -m liquidctl.cli list
   (should see your device here, if not stop)
$ sudo python3 -m liquidctl.cli -m node set led1 color fixed ff0000 --led-type 1 
    (should set the first led on the first fan to red everything else should be off)
$ sudo python3 -m liquidctl.cli -m node set led2 color fixed 00ff00 --led-type 1 
    (should set the first led on the first fan to red and the first led on fan2 should be green)
That is the behaviour I am currently expecting to occur and It assumes that you have the following setup

lighting node pro (channel 1) -> rgb hub -> LL fan
                             -> LL fan
If instead the first led is red and the second is green then my understanding of one of the fields is a little off (and I know how to fix it)
and if you could also test.

sudo python3 -m liquidctl.cli -m node set led color clear
sudo python3 -m liquidctl.cli -m node set led1 color rainbow --led-type 16
That should set the first fan to a rainbow effect (all of the LED's should not be the same color)
